## Introduction
The recent discovery of a kilonova associated with an apparent long-duration gamma-ray burst has challenged the typical classification that long gamma-ray bursts originate from the core collapse of massive stars and short gamma-ray bursts are from compact binary coalescence. 
The kilonova indicates a neutron star merger origin and suggests the viability of gravitational-wave and long gamma-ray burst multimessenger astronomy. Gravitational waves play a crucial role by providing independent informa- tion for the source properties. 
This work revisits the archival 2015-2020 LIGO/Virgo gravitational-wave candidates from the 4-OGC catalog which are consistent with a binary neutron star or neutron star- black hole merger and the long-duration gamma-ray bursts from the Fermi and Swift catalogs. 
We search for spatial and temporal coincidence with up to 10 s time lag between gravitational-wave candi- dates and the onset of long-duration GRBs. The most significant candidate association has only a false alarm rate of once every two years; given the LIGO/Virgo observational period, this is consistent with a null result. 
We report an exclusion distance for each search candidate for a fiducial gravitational-wave signal and conservative viewing angle assumptions.
